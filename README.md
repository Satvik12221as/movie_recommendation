# Movie Recommendation Project
This is a simple project where I built a movie recommendation system. The idea is to suggest movies that are similar to the ones you like. For example, if you enjoy a superhero movie,my Ml model will try to show you other action or adventure movies and I made this using Python and some basic machine learning.

Here are two csv files which i took them from kaggle and by using this dataset my ML model is predicting the similar movies.
